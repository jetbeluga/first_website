__Cleaning company is donating THOUSANDS of toilet paper rolls to elderly people who canâ€™t get supplies thanks to coronavirus panic-buying__

A cleaning company boss has donated more than 8,000 rolls of toilet paper to disabled and elderly people who can't get supplies due to coronavirus panic buying.

As Australians continue to ransack toilet paper aisles at supermarkets all over the county, the owner of Dexter's Cleaning in Melbourne decided to donate $5,000 worth of rolls to people in need.

Dexter Gordon, 32, told Daily Mail Australia he heard about the call for toilet rolls as part of a coronavirus care package for the elderly and disabled through local radio station Fox FM.

__Furious Australians have slammed a hoarder (left and inset) for stripping shelves clean of toilet paper, nappies and hand sanitiser to sell for inflated prices online. The man took to Facebook on Tuesday afternoon to offer single rolls for $5 and 24-packs for $100 but was met with a furious response. 'Inbox me for toilet paper, Hand sanitiser, nappies, baby formula and antiseptic wipes. Lots of stock. Happy to express post, no pickups,' the man wrote.__
